# Bloom's Chill Site

Check the Live Project [clicking here]()

I made this project following two main reasons: I wanted to work again with the bases since my actual jobe requires almost none coding skills, *and* I wanted a simple yet nostalgic site for myself to use as blog (something with old internet vibes.)

## Work with it

- Clone the repository with `git clone [Repository URL]`
- Install dependancies with `npm install`
- Have fun!

## Work with it

> You can make use of the code however **you DO NOT have authorization to use the images** in the following pages: **Index, Tsukiko, Alex, Art Status, Site Info and blogs with the tag 'My Art.'** Those are mine drawings for myself and my original characters I do not give any kind permissions to use them.
